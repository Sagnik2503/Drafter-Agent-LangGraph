# Drafter Agent

Hi there! This is my **Drafter Agent** — an AI-powered writing assistant I built as part of my journey exploring LangGraph and AI agent frameworks. I’m just getting started with LangGraph, and this project helps me experiment with how conversational AI can assist in drafting and managing documents.

---

## What This Project Does

Drafter Agent lets me interact naturally with an AI assistant to:

- Update and edit documents by simply chatting.
- Save the document to a local `.txt` file when I’m ready.
- Keep track of the conversation and document content across multiple turns.
- Use custom tools integrated with LangChain and Groq LLM.

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted to dive deeper into building AI agents using LangGraph’s state graph approach. This project is my playground to test out:

- Tool integrations for document handling.
- Stateful conversations with an LLM.
- How to combine custom logic with AI-generated content.
